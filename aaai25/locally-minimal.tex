\section{Locally Minimal Probabilistic Explanations}

Due to the complexity of finding minimal $\delta$-SR, it has been proposed to study ``locally minimal'' $\delta$-SR, which are $\delta$-SRs such that the removal of any feature from the explanation would decrease its probabilistic guarantee below $\delta$.
Interestingly, we can generalize a proof from~\cite{Arenas_Barcelo_Romero_Subercaseaux_2022} to show that, over lineal models under product distributions, every locally minimal $\delta$-SR is a minimal $\delta$-SR.

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
    Define the \emph{``locality''} gap $\textsc{lgap}(\vy)$ of a locally minimal $\delta$-SR $\vy$ as the smallest value $g$ such that $|\vy^\star|_\bot - |\vy|_\bot = g$ for some $\vy^\star \subseteq \vy$ that is a $\delta$-SR.
    If $g = 0$, then $\vy$ is globally minimal, and we are done. If $g$ were to be $1$, then $\vy$ would not be locally minimal, a contradiction. Therefore, we can safely assume $g \geq 2$ from now on.
    Let $\Lin, \vy$ be such that $\vy$ is locally minimal $\delta$-SR and $\textsc{lgap}(\vy) \geq 2$. We will find a contradiction by the following method:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $\vy^\star$ be the $\delta$-SR such that $| \vy \setminus \vy^\star | = \textsc{lgap}(\vy)$.
        \item Every feature in $\vy \setminus \vy^\star$ is either ``good'', if its score is positive, or ``bad'' if its score is negative.
        \item Fix any feature $i$ in $\vy \setminus \vy^\star$. If $i$ is good, then $\vy^\star \oplus i$ has probability greater equal than $\vy^\star$, and the gap has reduced.
                On the other hand, if $i$ is bad, then $\vy \ominus i$ has greater-equal probability than $\vy$, contradicting it being locally minimal.
    \end{itemize}


\end{proof}
